The unmitigated failure of TfL (Transport for London) managers to discuss pay with Woolwich Ferry workers means Unite will stage a five day strike.

The strike begins on Monday 24 October and ends on Friday 28 October.  87% of the workers who took part in the ballot voted for strike action.

The workers currently face a toxic combination of an employer refusing to discuss a pay deal for 2022, and management victimising and unfairly suspending workers on the service. Unite is challenging the inconsistent treatment of a number of older staff who have been unfairly suspended or dismissed. The service has also refused to discuss the over-reliance on agency workers and alternative working arrangements.

Unite general secretary Sharon Graham, said: “TfL has squandered the time it had to reach a resolution with the workforce. It is absolutely unacceptable for the ferry service to refuse to discuss improving pay in the middle of a cost of living crisis.

“The workers will begin strike action next week and they have the union’s rock solid support. The sooner TfL bosses realise that they must put forward a genuine proposal to end this dispute the better.” 

The troubled ferry operation has been plagued by poor employment relations for years, first with the previous operator Briggs Marine Contractors Ltd and now with TfL which has led to more than 30 days of strike action during 2021.

Unite regional officer Onay Kasab said: “This dispute clearly proves that regardless of the political colours worn by the employer we will steadfastly support our members.

“This is a Labour mayor under a Labour majority GLA who run TFL. They have failed these workers time and time again. Unite is determined to focus on the workplace and take the necessary action to win fair pay and to defend workers.”

The free service across the Thames opened in 1889 following the abolition of tolls across bridges to the west of London. There has been a ferry in place at the site since the 14th century.

But senior management’s refusal to make a decent pay award means that soon, some Shelter staff will be facing the very real threat of homelessness themselves.
Over 600 members of Unite, Britain and Ireland’s largest union, employed by the housing and homeless charity Shelter, will take ten days of strike action beginning on Monday 5th December in a dispute over pay.
Shelter management needs to invest in and protect its staff so they can continue their vital work on the frontline of the housing crisis
With over at least £13.4 million in reserves - significantly more than the reserves target of £8.9 million, Shelter can more than afford to pay its staff a decent wage. Reserves are saved for a rainy day – but Shelter staff cannot be any clearer that it’s currently pouring.

But senior management’s refusal to make a decent pay award means that soon, some Shelter staff will be facing the very real threat of homelessness themselves.

Over 600 members of Unite, Britain and Ireland’s largest union, employed by the housing and homeless charity Shelter, will take ten days of strike action beginning on Monday 5th December in a dispute over pay.

Shelter management needs to invest in and protect its staff so they can continue their vital work on the frontline of the housing crisis

With over at least £13.4 million in reserves - significantly more than the reserves target of £8.9 million, Shelter can more than afford to pay its staff a decent wage.

Reserves are saved for a rainy day – but Shelter staff cannot be any clearer that it’s currently pouring.

The National Union of Students (NUS) has backed the strikes, which will be the biggest ever to hit UK universities and could impact 2.5 million students.

The strikes are primarily about pay. Before this year, University staff had already seen the value of their pay eroded by 20% over the last 12 years. That’s like having to work one day a week for free. Because of soaring inflation, this year it has got a whole lot worse. Our pay award was 3% while inflation is running at over 10%. That’s a further cut of at least 7%. 

Pay cuts affect certain people more than others. The pay gap between black and white staff stands at 17% and the disability pay gap is 9%. The mean gender pay gap is 16%. The issue of pay, casualisation and impossible workloads are also intersectional: Women, Black and disabled staff were all disproportionately likely to report that their workload had increased, and the same groups are also disproportionately likely to be on casualised rather than permanent contracts.

University employers have the money. There are more students than ever paying student fees. But university managements prefer to use it to inflate their own huge salaries and to spend it on buildings and bridges than to ensure the pay of their staff keeps up with inflation.

But senior management’s refusal to make a decent pay award means that soon, some Shelter staff will be facing the very real threat of homelessness themselves.

Over 600 members of Unite, Britain and Ireland’s largest union, employed by the housing and homeless charity Shelter, will take ten days of strike action beginning on Monday 5th December in a dispute over pay.

Shelter management needs to invest in and protect its staff so they can continue their vital work on the frontline of the housing crisis

With over at least £13.4 million in reserves - significantly more than the reserves target of £8.9 million, Shelter can more than afford to pay its staff a decent wage. Reserves are saved for a rainy day – but Shelter staff cannot be any clearer that it’s currently pouring.

Outsourced security staff working at University College London (UCL) from the Independent Workers’ Union of Great Britain (IWGB) have voted unanimously to take strike action over pay and union recognition. This follows the launch of an ongoing campaign in May by the majority-BAME and migrant outsourced workers demanding to be brought in-house, after years of subcontractor mismanagement.

At the height of the cost of living crisis, security staff are demanding £15/hr, equivalent to the wage paid to security over two decades ago before outsourcing was introduced at UCL (and still paid to a small number of staff who have remained employed since that time and whose conditions are protected by TUPE).

Outsourced workers are also demanding an end to exploitative outsourcing at the university. In addition to low pay, the university’s security subcontractor Bidvest Noonan has failed to pay correct pension contributions and is responsible for repeated payroll errors. The university’s previous subcontractor Axis was responsible for many of the same issues, and also attempted to reduce staff working hours without consultation.

In 2019, outsourced workers took strike action over the university’s two-tier employment system; outsourced workers were denied the same rights as directly employed colleagues, including inferior sick pay, holiday, and pension entitlements. The campaign was successful, winning parity of terms and conditions with in-house staff. However, despite university management stating publicly in 2019 that it would review the outsourcing model which underlies persisting inequalities faced by this workforce, no action has been taken to bring workers in-house.

The workers, long shut out of every decision-making process, are also demanding union recognition. The IWGB represents the majority of security staff working at UCL but both UCL and Bidvest Noonan have rejected requests for voluntary union recognition.",ACTIVE,,51.522973,-0.132217,,ucu,

GMB members have smashed the threshold for strike action with an overwhelming majority, says GMB Union
Almost 100 workers at a Durham chemical company have voted to strike in anger over a real terms pay cut.
GMB members at Thomas Swan, in Consett, have overwhelmingly voted to take industrial action, with a majority of more than 92 per cent.
Five 24 hour strikes will take place on 30 Nov, Dec 7, 14 and 21 and 4 Jan.
A revised offer of 5.1 per cent – capped at £1,000, meaning the vast majority of the workforce would get even less – was overwhelmingly rejected. 
Andrew Blunt, GMB Organiser, said:  
“GMB members have smashed the threshold for strike action with an overwhelming majority.
“This sends a clear message to Thomas Swan.
“The directors are doing very well out of the business, but they tell hardworking members there is no money. 
“Thomas Swan needs to get back round the table and take a sensible approach and reward our members with an increase that will help them with the rising cost of living.
