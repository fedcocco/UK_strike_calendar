Unite is challenging the inconsistent treatment of a number of older staff who have been unfairly suspended or dismissed. The service has also refused to discuss the over-reliance on agency workers and alternative working arrangements.\n\nUnite general secretary Sharon Graham, said: “TfL has squandered the time it had to reach a resolution with the workforce. It is absolutely unacceptable for the ferry service to refuse to discuss improving pay in the middle of a cost of living crisis.\n\n“The workers will begin strike action next week and they have the union’s rock solid support. The sooner TfL bosses realise that they must put forward a genuine proposal to end this dispute the better.” \n\nThe troubled ferry operation has been plagued by poor employment relations for years, first with the previous operator Briggs Marine Contractors Ltd and now with TfL which has led to more than 30 days of strike action during 2021.\n\nUnite regional officer Onay Kasab said: “This dispute clearly proves that regardless of the political colours worn by the employer we will steadfastly support our members.\n\n“This is a Labour mayor under a Labour majority GLA who run TFL. They have failed these workers time and time again. Unite is determined to focus on the workplace and take the necessary action to win fair pay and to defend workers.”\n\nThe free service across the Thames opened in 1889 following the abolition of tolls across bridges to the west of London. There has been a ferry in place at the site since the 14th century.\n\n","strike_status":"ACTIVE","status":null,"location":{"lat":51.494471,"lng":0.06136},"twitter_handles":null,"union":null},{"id":21715,"trade_unions_taking_action":"Public and Commercial Services Union","email_solidarity":"membership@pcs.org.uk","employer_name":"Bristol Magistrates' Court and Tribunals Hearing Centre�","action_reason":"Working conditions e.g. Change to conditions/workload","action_start":"2022-12-05T00:00:00+00:00","constituency":"Bristol West","region":"South West","country":"England","more_information":"Pickets 2, 3, 4-5 December 2022","strike_status":"ACTIVE","status":null,"location":{"lat":51.459478,"lng":-2.593019},"twitter_handles":null,"union":null},{"id":21726,"trade_unions_taking_action":"Public and Commercial Services Union","email_solidarity":"membership@pcs.org.uk","employer_name":"Grimsby Magistrates' Court and Family Court�","action_reason":"Working conditions e.g. Change to conditions/workload","action_start":"2022-12-02T00:00:00+00:00","constituency":"Great Grimsby","region":"Yorkshire and The Humber","country":"England","more_information":"Pickets 2, 3, 4-5 December 2022","strike_status":"ACTIVE","status":null,"location":{"lat":53.569096,"lng":-0.080597},"twitter_handles":null,"union":null},{"id":22091,"trade_unions_taking_action":"University and College Union","email_solidarity":"campaigns@ucu.org.uk","employer_name":"University of Wolverhampton – City–Telford","action_reason":"Pay & conditions","action_start":"2022-11-30T00:00:00+00:00","constituency":"Wolverhampton South West","region":"West Midlands","country":"England","more_information":"National strike dates 24, 25 & 30 November.

This follows the launch of an ongoing campaign in May by the majority-BAME and migrant outsourced workers demanding to be brought in-house, after years of subcontractor mismanagement.\n\nAt the height of the cost of living crisis, security staff are demanding £15/hr, equivalent to the wage paid to security over two decades ago before outsourcing was introduced at UCL (and still paid to a small number of staff who have remained employed since that time and whose conditions are protected by TUPE).\n\nOutsourced workers are also demanding an end to exploitative outsourcing at the university. In addition to low pay, the university’s security subcontractor Bidvest Noonan has failed to pay correct pension contributions and is responsible for repeated payroll errors. The university’s previous subcontractor Axis was responsible for many of the same issues, and also attempted to reduce staff working hours without consultation.\n\nIn 2019, outsourced workers took strike action over the university’s two-tier employment system; outsourced workers were denied the same rights as directly employed colleagues, including inferior sick pay, holiday, and pension entitlements. The campaign was successful, winning parity of terms and conditions with in-house staff. However, despite university management stating publicly in 2019 that it would review the outsourcing model which underlies persisting inequalities faced by this workforce, no action has been taken to bring workers in-house.\n\nThe workers, long shut out of every decision-making process, are also demanding union recognition. The IWGB represents the majority of security staff working at UCL but both UCL and Bidvest Noonan have rejected requests for voluntary union recognition.","strike_status":"ACTIVE","status":null,"location":{"lat":51.522973,"lng":-0.132217},"twitter_handles":null,"union":{"slug":"ucu"}},{"id":21834,"trade_unions_taking_action":"National Education Union","email_solidarity":"robert.phillips@neu.org.uk","employer_name":"Luton Sixth Form College","action_reason":"Pay","action_start":"2022-11-30T00:00:00+00:00","constituency":"Luton North","region":"East of England","country":"England","more_information":"https://neu.org.uk/press-releases/sixth-form-colleges-ballot-result","strike_status":"ACTIVE","status":null,"location":{"lat":51.903716,"lng":-0.414304},"twitter_handles":null,"union":{"slug":"neu"}},{"id":22167,"trade_unions_taking_action":"University and College Union","email_solidarity":"campaigns@ucu.org.uk","employer_name":"Manchester Metropolitan University (MMU)","action_reason":"Pay & conditions","action_start":"2022-11-30T00:00:00+00:00","constituency":"Manchester Central","region":"North West","country":"England","more_information":"National strike dates 24, 25 & 30 November.

The offer is a pay cut when the real rate of inflation, RPI, stands at 14.2 per cent and rising.\n\nUnite general secretary Sharon Graham said: “Harrods and its owners, the Qatar Investment Authority, can absolutely afford to pay these workers a rise that reflects soaring living costs. Harrods, like many Qatari state enterprises, is known the world over for luxury and extravagance, an impression maintained off the backs of workers. Our members at Harrods have Unite’s full support as they fight for a fair pay rise.” \n\nHarrods made a profit of £51 million in 2021/22 and doubled the pay of its managing director Michael Ward to £2.3 million, even though the company claimed nearly £6 million under the government’s Covid furlough scheme.\n\nThe strike action will be accompanied by a picket line outside of Harrods’ main entrance in Knightsbridge.
